# houseboat-rental

This app simulates a basic order form for a boat rental company.  The code validates the arrival and departure date/time and throws an exception if the input is not logical.  Methods in the code also return fee totals for the engine, extra passengers, and trip duration.  The program was written for an intro C# course.
